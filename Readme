
QWalk 1.4 - Quantum Walk Simulator
----------------------------------



1) THIS software has the following structure of directories:

 /bin - contains the executable files
 /src - contains the source code of the simulator
 /lib - contains the library and object files generated after make
 /include - contains the header files
 /examples - some examples that can be run after installing the simulator
 /doc - documentation (code listing and articles)



2) AFTER running make we have in bin directory:

 qw1d - performs simulations of quantum walks on one-dimensional lattices
 qw2d - performs simulations of quantum walks on bi-dimensional lattices
 qwamplify - ampliflies some regions of wave function



3) IN src directory we have:

 Makefile 

 (files with the main functions)
 qw1d.c
 qw2d.c       
 qwamplify.c  

 (files with important functions used in qw1d.c and qw2d.c)
 qw1d_sub.c
 qw2d_sub.c

 (files for memory management)
 qwmem_int.c
 qwmem_real.c
 qwmem_complex.c

 (core files)
 qwcoin.c     
 qwlinks.c     
 qwscreen.c   
 qwstatistics.c
 qwmeasure.c   
 qwprob.c             
 qwstate.c    

 (files for input and output)
 qwextra_io.c
 qwoptions_io.c
 qwoptions_io_read.c
 qwprob_io.c
 qwstate_io.c
 qwcoin_io.c
 qwstatistics_io.c



4) IMPORTANT: If you change any of the source files, add comments saying what 
   functions you have changed and rename the main directory (for instance, 
   from qwalk-1.4 to something like myQwalk, or qwalk_tmp, etc).



5) AFTER running make we have in lib directory:

 libqwalk.a
 object files ending with .o
 


6) IN include directory, we have:

 qw1d_sub.h
 qw2d_sub.h
 qwamplify.h

 qwmem_complex.h
 qwmem_int.h
 qwmem_real.h

 qwcoin.h
 qwscreen.h
 qwstatistics.h 
 qwprob.h
 qwstate.h
 qwlinks.h
 qwconsts.h
 qwmeasure.h

 qwcoin_io.h
 qwprob_io.h
 qwstate_io.h
 qwextra_io.h
 qwstatistics_io.h
 qwoptions_io.h
 qwoptions_io_read.h



7) IMPORTANT: If you change any of the header files, add comments saying what
   you have changed and rename the main directory (for instance, from qwalk-1.4 
   to something like myQwalk, or qwalk_tmp, etc).
