
QWalk 1.4 - Quantum Walk Simulator
----------------------------------

To compile the source files in Linux (or similar operating systems):

1. Type the commands
      cd src
      make 

2. If you want to clean the object files after compiling, type the command
      make clean

3. If you want to generate a PostScript file with the code listing, type
      make doc

4. It may be useful to add a path to the bin directory. There may be
   different ways of doing this. If you use bash, for instance, you may
   add the lines 
      PATH=$PATH:$HOME/qwalk/bin
      export PATH
   to the file .bash_profile in your home directory and log in again. If
   you do not want to do this, you should type the correct path when running
   the simulator, e.g., ../bin/qw2d if you are in the "examples" directory.

To compile the source files in Windows you may use the Dev-C++ projects 
present in this distribution with the Dev-C++ compiler, which is 
available for free in Internet (http://www.bloodshed.net/); or you may
use the compiler of your preference. Pre-compiled versions are also
provided in the web-site where you probably downloaded this file 
(http://qubit.lncc.br/qwalk/).
