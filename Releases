Version 1.4 (11/2012)
--------------------

* Changes in qw2d:
    - New lattice type, with cyclic boundary conditions: LATTYPE CYCLE
    - Improved gnuplot scripts for better compatibility with different versions of gnuplot


Version 1.3 (12/2008)
---------------------

* Changes in qw1d:
    - Definition of detectors: DETECTORS
    - Selection of number of steps to be carried out after a non-trivial measurement: AFTERMEASURE


Version 1.2 (11/2007)
---------------------

* Changes in qw1d:
    - Saves the final complex amplitudes of the state
    - Simulation of decoherence with random measurements: DTPROB
    - Gnuplot scripts now ends with .plt instead of .gpt
    - Improved gnuplot scripts for better compatibility with different versions of gnuplot (previous 
      versions were tested in gnuplot 4.0)
    - Stationary distribution output file now ends with -pb.dat instead of .pb
    - BEGINSTATE is now closed just by ENDSTATE, i.e., it is not necessary to close the section with -1.
    - MIXTIME keyword was introduced as a synonym for CALCMIX. The latter may desapear in future versions.
